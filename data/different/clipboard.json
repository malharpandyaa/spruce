I'll guide you through both local testing (without a remote repository) and testing with a remote repository (e.g., GitHub). This will help you verify that the Git integration in your Electron application works as expected.\n\nTesting Git Functionality Locally\nTesting locally allows you to ensure that Git operations like initializing a repository, adding changes, committing, and checking the status work correctly within your application, without the need for a remote repository.\n\nStep-by-Step Guide for Local Testing\n1. Launch Your Application\nStart the Application: Run your Electron application using the command:\n\nbash\nCopy code\nnpm start\n2. Create or Select a Project\nOpen the Dashboard: Click the Dashboard button in the sidebar to open the dashboard window.\nCreate a New Project (optional): If you want to test with a new project, enter a project name in the \"New project name\" field and click Add.\nSelect a Project: Click the Select button next to the project you want to work with. The selected project becomes the active project.\n3. Open the Git Interface\nOpen Git Window: Click the Git button (branch icon) in the sidebar to open the Git interface window.\n4. Initialize a Git Repository\nInitialize Repository: In the Git interface, click the Initialize Repository button. This will run git init in the project's data directory, creating a new Git repository.\nCheck Output: Look at the Git output area to confirm that the repository has been initialized successfully.\n5. Make Changes to Your Project Data\nAdd Notes: Open the Notes window and add some text to the notes area.\nAdd Tasks: Open the Tasks window and add some tasks.\nClipboard Entries: Copy some text or images to add entries to your clipboard history.\n6. Check Git Status\nView Status: In the Git interface, click the Status button to see the current status of your repository.\nReview Output: The Git output area will display information about untracked and modified files.\n7. Stage Changes\nAdd All Changes: Click the Add All Changes button to stage all new and modified files for committing. This runs git add ..\n8. Commit Changes\nEnter Commit Message: In the Commit message field, type a meaningful message describing your changes (e.g., \"Initial commit with notes and tasks\").\nCommit Changes: Click the Commit button to commit the staged changes. This runs git commit -m \"Your message\".\n9. Verify Commit\nCheck Output: The Git output area should confirm that the changes have been committed.\nView Status Again: Click Status to confirm that there are no more changes to commit.\nCongratulations!\nYou've successfully tested the Git functionality locally. You can repeat the process of making changes and committing them to further test the integration.\n\nTesting Git Functionality with a Remote Repository\nTesting with a remote repository allows you to verify that you can push and pull changes to and from a remote Git server like GitHub.\n\nPrerequisites\n"},{"type":"image","data":"image_1.png"},{"type":"image","data":"image_2.png"}]
